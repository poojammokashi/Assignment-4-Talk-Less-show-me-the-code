Is JSX mandiatory for React?
=>JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you donâ€™t want to set up compilation in your build 
environment.
Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children). So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done
with just plain JavaScript.

What is <React.fragment></React.fragment> and <></>?
React Fragments allow you to wrap or group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.
